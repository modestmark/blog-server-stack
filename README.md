# SERVER STACK FOR BLOG whose domain name hasn't been decided on yet ahem
MAINTAINER:  Mark Gagnon

This is the stack run on the blog's VPS.  It uses nginx, gunicorn, and postgresql.
Each service is run in its own Docker container.

The VPS setup is tailored for a Debian environment.


PS:  I rule.
