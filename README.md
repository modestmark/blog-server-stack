# SERVER STACK FOR BLOG whose domain name hasn't been decided on yet ahem
MAINTAINER:  Mark Gagnon

This is the stack run on the blog's VPS.  It uses nginx, gunicorn, and postgresql.

The VPS setup is tailored for a Debian environment.

#TODO:
-Run each service as a microservice in Docker containers.
-Plenty of other stuff I can't think of at the moment

PS:  I rule.
